> **Bring the power of Roo Code (Cline) to JetBrains IDEs. A community-driven effort to provide a stable, feature-rich experience where official support is missing.**

Roo Code for JetBrains (Community Edition) allows you to run the full [Roo Code](https://roocode.com) AI assistant within the JetBrains ecosystem. It solves the problem of Roo Code lacking an official, stable plugin for JetBrains IDEs by providing a deeply optimized environment to run the VSCode-based agent.

### 💡 Why this version?
While an official branding fork exists, it inherits many unresolved issues from the original RunVSAgent project, making it difficult to use in daily production. This community edition (**abcxlab**) is dedicated to fixing those gaps:

*   **Truly Usable**: Fixed critical JCEF timing bugs, editor concurrency deadlocks, and UI freezes that often plague the official version.
*   **Feature Parity**: Integrated support for Checkpoints, Problem Selectors, and full Keymap/i18n—ensuring the JetBrains experience matches the VSCode original.
*   **Production Ready**: Optimized for professional use across all JetBrains IDEs, including first-class support for PyCharm.
